Diffie–Hellman is commonly used to establish shared secret keys securely over public networks. In the TLS handshake, it lets a client and server generate a common encryption key without sending it directly, protecting the session from interception. In secure messaging systems like the Signal Protocol, an advanced version of Diffie–Hellman (the Double Ratchet algorithm) ensures forward secrecy so that previous messages remain safe even if long-term keys are exposed. Overall, Diffie–Hellman is essential for secure communication because it enables safe key exchange and prevents attackers from accessing private information.
